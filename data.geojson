Our preaching is relevant and insightful. In addition to Rev\u2019d. Dr. Karen Coleman, our priest, we have several theologically-trained lay-preachers who regularly bring their voices to the pulpit. Children are a vital part of our ministry at St. James. Our Sunday School meets during the first part of the service, after which the children join the rest of the congregation for the celebration of the Holy Eucharist. Children are encouraged to take communion if their parents are so inclined. During our weekly celebration of the Holy Communion, all are welcome to come to the Lord\u2019s table, regardless of where they find themselves on their spiritual journeys. Your presence and participation in our worship would enrich all of us. In the name of the Risen Christ, we extend a warm welcome to everyone."
